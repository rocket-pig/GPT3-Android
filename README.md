My 'compile-apk-helloworld-in-termux' project was 
used as platform for multiple exploratory attempts 
at making a more complete android app in javascript, 
and finally succeeded with this GPT-3 API project.

The APK is available in [releases](https://github.com/rocket-pig/GPT3-Android/releases/tag/final) or compile
yourself with:

Run build from top (this) dir with 
```./build.sh project/```

ALT-ENTER can be used as shortcut to send text instead of clicking the airplane.
