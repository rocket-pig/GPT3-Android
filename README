My 'compile-apk-helloworld-in-termux' project was 
used as platform for multiple exploratory attempts 
at making an android app with javascript, and 
finally succeeded with this GPT-3 API, using OnsenUI, 
project. 

The APK is available in (LINK) 'releases' or compile
yourself with:

Run build from top (this) dir with 
./build.sh project/
